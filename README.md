Weather App
Overview
The Weather App is a full-stack application that provides real-time weather information for any location around the world. Users can search for a city and view current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. Additionally, the app sends email notifications about weather alerts using Nodemailer. MongoDB Atlas is used to store user data.

Features
Real-time Weather Data: Get live weather updates, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
5-Day Forecast: View the weather forecast for the upcoming week.
Search Functionality: Search for any city globally and retrieve weather data.
Email Notifications: Users can subscribe to receive weather updates via email.
MongoDB Atlas: User data and subscription preferences are stored securely in the cloud.
Responsive UI: A clean, mobile-friendly interface built with Bootstrap.
Design Choices
Frontend: Built using React for responsive design.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic and routing.
Database: MongoDB Atlas for storing user email preferences.
Weather API: OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving weather data.
Email Service: Nodemailer for sending email notifications.
State Management : Redux for user state management.
Charts : Recharts to create charts for better understanding.
Error Handling: User-friendly messages for invalid searches and other issues.

Build Instructions

Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
MongoDB Atlas: Set up a free MongoDB Atlas cluster.
OpenWeatherMap API Key: Sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Nodemailer Configuration: You’ll need access to an SMTP service (e.g., Gmail) for sending emails.

Setting up the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the required Node.js modules:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install

cd backend
npm install

Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following:

bash
Copy code
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
DB=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
SMTP_USER=your_email_address
SMTP_PASS=your_email_password (generated by gmail to give access to app so that user can use)
SMTP_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
SMTP_PORT = 465
PORT = 3000
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000"
JWT_SECRET = your_token_to_use

MONGODB_URI: Connection string from your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS: Credentials for the email account you want to use for sending notifications (e.g., Gmail).

Run the application: Start the Node.js server using:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the app.Dependencies

Here are the main dependencies required to run the project:

Node.js: Handles backend logic and routing.
Express.js: Manages the web server.
MongoDB Atlas: A cloud database for storing user data.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
Nodemailer: Handles email sending functionality.
Dotenv: For loading environment variables (like the API key, email credentials, and MongoDB connection string).
JsonWebToken: Used for securely handling user authentication and authorization.
Nodemon: A development tool that automatically restarts the server when code changes are detected.
Bcryptjs: For hashing passwords and ensuring secure password storage.
Cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend from different origins.
Recharts: A charting library for React to display data visualizations (e.g., graphs and charts for weather data).
react-router-dom: For managing client-side routing in React applications.
Redux: A state management library for JavaScript applications, used here to manage application-wide states in React.

Install all of these by running npm install after cloning the repository.

Design Decisions
Cloud Database: MongoDB Atlas is used for its scalability and ease of integration with Node.js through Mongoose. This stores user data, such as email addresses for weather notifications.
Email Notifications: Nodemailer is integrated for sending weather updates to subscribed users. The app uses environment variables to securely store email credentials.
Frontend/Backend Separation: The frontend handles user input and displays weather data, while the backend handles API requests, data storage, and email sending.
Future Improvements
Implement user authentication to allow personalized settings and data management.
Add geolocation support to fetch weather data based on the user’s current location.
Add more customization options for email notifications (e.g., daily summaries).
Improve error handling with more detailed feedback for the user.
